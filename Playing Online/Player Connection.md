## Player Connection

If you want to join a server, you'll need to set up some informations in the Connection Info.ini file. The **[Player Info]** tag will contain your username and password.
The **[Game Client Info]** will contain a serie of Game Server IPs to connect to. If there's more than 1 it will pick one at random.
The **[Communication Client Info]** section behave in the same way but for communications.
