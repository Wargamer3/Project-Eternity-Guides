## Quick Start

It’s already a pretty colossal task to make a game but making a game in an unknown engine is even harder. To help with that we’ll go through the basic asset creation needed to make a game. For more in depth information you can check the official guide [here](https://wargamer3.github.io/Project-Eternity/).
This tutorial will teach you about:

1. Creating Unit/Pilot/Attacks
1. Creating a map
1. Creating dialogues
1. Creating cutscenes
1. Creating animations (Optional)



After doing all of this you’ll have a fully working stage and you’ll be able to start tying them together to make a proper story.
The order of asset creation is not important, you can easily split the work between multiple people without getting blocked anywhere if you use placeholders where needed.
This tutorial will follow the creation of a demo for SRWE so you can follow it by using any [demo](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fysuf794cxnm820/SRWE%20Everything%20demo.zip?dl=0).
