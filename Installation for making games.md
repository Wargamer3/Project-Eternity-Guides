## Installation for making games

Be sure to have installed the latest Microsoft XNA Framework Redistributable: 
[http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=20914](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=20914)

And the .NET Framework 4.6.1 [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461)

Download the SRWE build [https://www.dropbox.com/s/t7z4ssq0tkm3iri/SRWE%20internal%20demo.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t7z4ssq0tkm3iri/SRWE%20internal%20demo.zip?dl=0)

That’s it. It’s a standalone system so the development folder is the same as the release folder. If you want to make a proper release you can just delete the GUI and the editor folder.
