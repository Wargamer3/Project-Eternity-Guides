## Creating Characters
![CharacterEditor]({{site.baseurl}}/Images/Sorcerer Street/Character Editor/Character Editor.png)

The Character Editor let you enter a name, a price if the character can be bought in the shop and a description.
At the top you have more options.

On the right you can set some unique traits to your character but are disabled by default by most game modes.
First you can assign spells that this character will able to use at any time, it work the same way as spell cards but use special Spell Points to activate.
Then you can set passive skills, those are activated automatically depending if the requirement is met. They can be fully passive like a skill that increase the cost of all fire cards by 50% or they can give you a free card when you defeat a creature.

In the second tab you have access to the blacklist and whitelist options. They let you limit which cards the character can or can't use. If you only want fire card, use the whitelist with fire card, it will prevent anything else from being used. If you only want to block specific cards, use the blacklist. Both whitelist and blacklist support specific card names or entire categories like Fire Cards or Spell Cards.
